		Prism AI is an AI-powered experience planner that transforms the way you discover and curate cross-domain adventures. By leveraging Qloo’s Taste AI™ Insights API alongside an AI “concierge,” the app stitches together personalized recommendations across movies, music, dining, and more into a seamless itinerary. Whether you’re in the mood for a cozy mystery–themed evening or a high-energy Marvel and EDM fusion night, Prism AI crafts a cohesive plan—suggesting the perfect film, pairing it with a thematic recipe or local restaurant, and complementing it with a fitting playlist—all grounded in data-driven affinities and cultural context.

	<p class="intro-description">
		Every recommendation is fully customizable from start to finish. Simply share a few details about yourself, a theme and a timeframe, and Prism AI curates suggestions across multiple domains. It then weaves them into a compelling narrative, presenting each choice with rich visuals and highlighting the cultural connections that bind your experience together. Want a tweak? Just swap an item or refine your preferences—Prism AI updates your personalized experience quickly, making every exciting night out or quiet day at home feel handcrafted just for you.
