## Overview
Prism AI is an AI-powered experience planner that curates cross-domain adventures tailored to your tastes. By combining Qloo’s Taste AI™ Insights API with a custom AI "concierge," Prism AI delivers seamless, personalized recommendations—spanning movies, music, dining, and more—into a cohesive, data-driven itinerary.

## Key Features
- **Personalized Experience Planning:** Users receive curated recommendations based on their profile, interests, and preferences, all woven into a narrative journey.
- **Multi-Domain Curation:** Prism AI connects entertainment, dining, and activities, suggesting thematic pairings (e.g., movie + restaurant + playlist) for a unique outing or night in.
- **Interactive Customization:** Every recommendation is fully customizable. Users can swap items, refine preferences, and instantly update their experience.
- **Rich Visuals & Context:** Each suggestion is presented with images, descriptions, and cultural context, highlighting the connections that make the experience memorable.


## How It Works
1. **Profile & Preferences:** Users enter basic info (age, gender, interests) and select a theme or timeframe.
2. **LLM-Powered API Integration:** Prism AI’s agents use large language models (LLMs) to dynamically formulate requests to Qloo’s Insights API, leveraging user data to query for the most relevant, cross-domain recommendations.
3. **Interpretation & Personalization:** The same agents interpret the rich, structured results from Qloo—extracting actionable insights, visualizing data, and weaving them into a compelling, personalized narrative.
4. **Concierge Guidance:** The AI "concierge" explains the choices, offers alternatives, and helps users refine their plan in natural language.
5. **Timeline & Details:** The app presents a step-by-step itinerary, complete with visuals and cultural insights.


## AI Agents, LLMs, and Qloo API Integration
Prism AI’s architecture centers on specialized AI agents, orchestrated by the `IAiAgentService` interface and powered by LLMs. These agents both formulate advanced queries to Qloo’s Insights API and interpret the results, enabling:

- **Dynamic API Request Generation:** LLMs analyze user input and context to construct precise, multi-parameter API calls—leveraging Qloo’s vast catalog of cultural entities, demographic data, and geospatial insights.
- **Result Interpretation & Personalization:** Agents parse and synthesize Qloo’s structured responses, extracting actionable insights and presenting them as personalized, cross-domain recommendations.
- **Conversational Guidance:** The AI "concierge" uses LLMs to explain, refine, and adapt recommendations in real time, making the experience interactive and user-friendly.

### Qloo API Tools Available to Agents
Through the `QlooPlugin`, LLM-powered agents can:
- Retrieve taste and demographic metadata (`CallQlooTastes`, `CallQlooDemographicInsights`)
- Query for deep entity insights across domains (`CallQlooEntityInsights`)
- Search for entities, tags, and audiences (`SearchForEntities`, `SearchForTags`, `GetAudiences`)
- Find related alternatives and tag types (`FindRelatedAlternativeEntities`, `GetTagTypes`)
- Access allowed parameters for any entity type (`GetAllowedParametersForEntityType`)

This toolset allows agents to flexibly explore Qloo’s API, adapt to user needs, and deliver recommendations that are both culturally rich and contextually relevant.

## Additional Integrations

To enrich and expand the recommendations generated by the Qloo API, Prism AI integrates several additional services:

- **Book Discovery:**
	- Via the `BookPlugin`, agents can search Google Books for relevant titles, adding curated reading lists or thematic book suggestions that complement Qloo-powered experiences.

- **Web Search & Summarization:**
	- The `WebCrawlPlugin` enables agents to perform live web searches, extract and summarize web content, retrieve images, and convert web pages to markdown. This provides up-to-date information, supporting details, and citations that enhance the core Qloo recommendations.

- **YouTube Video Search:**
	- Through the `YouTubePlugin`, agents can search YouTube for videos that match user interests or itinerary themes, embedding video content to further contextualize and personalize Qloo-driven suggestions.

- **Interactive Maps & Directions:**
	- The `MapViewer` component (with supporting JavaScript interop) displays interactive maps and directions for recommended destinations, helping users visualize and plan their experiences with real-world context, all rooted in Qloo’s cultural intelligence.

These integrations are orchestrated by the AI agents to supplement and expand upon Qloo’s recommendations, creating a rich, multi-modal experience plan tailored to each user.
